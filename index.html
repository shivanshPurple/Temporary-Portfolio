          <h6>Duration : 2-3 weeks</h6>

          <p class="paragraph">A website was needed to manage the cryptocurrency shares. The website was built using
            Flutter, Dart and Firebase. A lot of people had there shares in one portfolio and it was difficult to manage
            and tell everyone's profit and loss. So this was the solution that automatically divides the shares based on
            their percentage. <br> The web app has regular 50-100 visits per day for now and has a sleek and clean
            design.
            It is a real time application that keeps on updating every second. It can also show the profit and loss in
            different currencies.

          <h2>Custom Reddit Feed</h2>

          <h6>Duration : 1-2 months</h6>

          <p class="paragraph">January of 2021 I was looking for a new way to get my daily news and memes feed. I
            recently learnt Flutter and wanted to make more of it. So, I decided to make a custom news feed that shows
            the top posts from Reddit. The app is built using Python, Flask and API. The server refreshes everyday at 4
            o'clock in the morning. The server side details is in the python section of this page. There are plans to
            also include Instagram feed too.<br>
            The design is sleek and futuristic. The UI inspiration is from Tinder. It is currently under development and
            needs more polishing.

          <h2>Automatic Monotonous Messaging</h2>
          <h5>● Dart ● Android Java ● Android Alarms </h5>
          <h6>Duration : 2-3 days</h6>
          <br>
          <p class="paragraph">A small app that sends you reminders in the form of notifications to send messages to
            someone on a certain day/time. It can automatically type out a random message and send its intent to
            whatsapp. The user just has to click on the notification and it will send the message. The user can save
            their friends' nicknames and their phone numbers and the type of random messages you want to send.
            <br>
            Here is an example usecase where the app sends you a notification to send good morning wishes to someone.
