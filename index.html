          <p class="paragraph">A website was needed to manage the cryptocurrency shares. The website was built using
            Flutter, Dart and Firebase. A lot of people had there shares in one portfolio and it was difficult to manage
            and tell everyone's profit and loss. So this was the solution that automatically divides the shares based on
            their percentage. <br> The web app has regular 50-100 visits per day for now and has a sleek and clean
            design.
            It is a real time application that keeps on updating every second. It can also show the profit and loss in
            different currencies.

          <h6>Duration : 1-2 months</h6>

          <p class="paragraph">January of 2021 I was looking for a new way to get my daily news and memes feed. I
            recently learnt Flutter and wanted to make more of it. So, I decided to make a custom news feed that shows
            the top posts from Reddit. The app is built using Python, Flask and API. The server refreshes everyday at 4
            o'clock in the morning. The server side details is in the python section of this page. There are plans to
            also include Instagram feed too.<br>
            The design is sleek and futuristic. The UI inspiration is from Tinder. It is currently under development and
            needs more polishing.

          <p class="paragraph">A small app that sends you reminders in the form of notifications to send messages to
            someone on a certain day/time. It can automatically type out a random message and send its intent to
            whatsapp. The user just has to click on the notification and it will send the message. The user can save
            their friends' nicknames and their phone numbers and the type of random messages you want to send.
            <br>
            Here is an example usecase where the app sends you a notification to send good morning wishes to someone.

            <h2>Reinforced Learning - Path Detection</h2>
            <h5> ● C# ● Reinforcement Learning ● Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) ● Car Physics</h5>
            <h6>Duration : 4 months</h6>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">This was the project at the end of my first year in college. I game myself a task to
              design a path detection system for a car via reinforcement learning. After a lot of failed attempts in the
              first 2 months (mainly because I was using Unity's ML-Kit that was in beta at that time and less
              documentation), I finally managed to make it work. <br><br>
              I used the NEAT algorithm to create a neural network that can detect the path. The neural network is
              completely written in C# by me. This neural network is trained using the Reinforcement Learning algorithm
              that means it learns from the mistakes it makes. The cars that makes least mistakes are the ones that are
              most likely to produce next generations of cars. These car reproduce and mutate to create new cars.
              This process is repeated for a certain number of generations. <br><br>
              This is a very interesting project that I have done for a long time and learnt a lot from it. For
              example: I have learnt to ditch ideas that don't work even if I had invested a lot of time in them and
              try other ideas.
