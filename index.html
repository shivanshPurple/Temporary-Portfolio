                <p class="paragraph">This was the project at the end of my first year in college. I game myself a task
                  to design a path detection system for a car via reinforcement learning. After a lot of failed
                  attempts in the first 2 months (mainly because I was using Unity's ML-Kit that was in beta at that
                  time and less documentation), I finally managed to make it work. <br><br>
                  I used the NEAT algorithm to create a neural network that can detect the path. The neural network is
                  completely written in C# by me. This neural network is trained using the Reinforcement Learning
                  algorithm that means it learns from the mistakes it makes. The cars that makes least mistakes are
                  the ones that are most likely to produce next generations of cars. These car reproduce and mutate to
                  create new cars. This process is repeated for a certain number of generations. <br><br>
                  This is a very interesting project that I have done for a long time and learnt a lot from it. For
                  example: I have learnt to ditch ideas that don't work even if I had invested a lot of time in them
                  and try other ideas.

                <p class="paragraph">I created a game for my girlfriend for her birthday and Valentines week which falls
                  in the same week. Its a story driven 8-bit platformer game with interactive dialogues throughout the whole game.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  Along with creating the 8 bit platformer for her, I also included real life presents that she couldn't open yet. 
                  And the presents were linked to the game but with a catch. <br/>
                  Each level that she'd conquer, (with great effort, haha) she'd unlock a digit to the code on her hidden presents. 
                  But not so fast. Each level would be unlocked when two things were True simultaneously: The previous level is completed, 
                  and another day has started - ie. at 12 midnight. <br/>
                  This ensured that when all the levels are completed one by one with 7 levels in total, and she's on the last level - 
                  the last one that will open on Valentine's day (cuz her birthday falls on valentines week), She'd unlock the 
                  last digit to the lock when opening the final chest, and then opening her presents irl with the grand completion of 
                  the game itself.

                  using
                  Flutter, Dart and Firebase. A lot of people had there shares in one portfolio and it was difficult to
                  manage
                  and tell everyone's profit and loss. So this was the solution that automatically divides the shares
                  based
                  on
                  their percentage. <br> The web app has regular 50-100 visits per day for now and has a sleek and clean
                  design.
                  It is a real time application that keeps on updating every second. It can also show the profit and
                  loss in
                  different currencies.

                <p class="paragraph">January of 2021 I was looking for a new way to get my daily news and memes feed. I
                  recently learnt Flutter and wanted to make more of it. So, I decided to make a custom news feed that
                  shows the top posts from Reddit. The app is built using Python, Flask and API. The server refreshes
                  everyday at 4 o'clock in the morning. The server side details is in the python section of this page.
                  There are plans to also include Instagram feed too.<br>
                  The design is sleek and futuristic. The UI inspiration is from Tinder. It is currently under
                  development and needs more polishing.<br><br>
                  The backend server is written in Python and uses Flask for the backend. The server is hosted on AWS
                  and uses PostgreSQL for the database. The server is responsible for fetching the data from the Reddit
                  API and storing it in the database for the app to use. <br>

                  saved
                  alot of time and effort. It takes about 10-15 minutes to create 100 different mockups.
