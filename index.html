          <h6>Duration : 4 months</h6>

          <p class="paragraph">This was the project at the end of my first year in college. I game myself a task to
            design a path detection system for a car via reinforcement learning. After a lot of failed attempts in the
            first 2 months (mainly because I was using Unity's ML-Kit that was in beta at that time and less
            documentation), I finally managed to make it work. <br><br>
            I used the NEAT algorithm to create a neural network that can detect the path. The neural network is
            completely written in C# by me. This neural network is trained using the Reinforcement Learning algorithm
            that means it learns from the mistakes it makes. The cars that makes least mistakes are the ones that are
            most likely to produce next generations of cars. These car reproduce and mutate to create new cars.
            This process is repeated for a certain number of generations. <br><br>
            This is a very interesting project that I have done for a long time and learnt a lot from it. For
            example: I have learnt to ditch ideas that don't work even if I had invested a lot of time in them and
            try other ideas.

            o'clock in the morning. The server side details is in the python section of this page. There are plans to
            also include Instagram feed too.<br>

            PostgreSQL for the database. The server is responsible for fetching the data from the Reddit API and storing
            it in the database for the app to use. <br>
