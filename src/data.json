      "description": "This was the project at the end of my first year in college. I game myself a task to design a path detection system for a car via reinforcement learning. After a lot of failed attempts in the first 2 months (mainly because I was using Unity's ML-Kit that was in beta at that time and less documentation), I finally managed to make it work. I used the NEAT algorithm to create a neural network that can detect the path. The neural network is completely written in C# by me. This neural network is trained using the Reinforcement Learning algorithm that means it learns from the mistakes it makes. The cars that makes least mistakes are the ones that are most likely to produce next generations of cars. These car reproduce and mutate to create new cars. This process is repeated for a certain number of generations. This is a very interesting project that I have done for a long time and learnt a lot from it. For example: I have learnt to ditch ideas that don't work even if I had invested a lot of time in them and try other ideas.",

Its a story driven 8-bit platformer game with interactive dialogues throughout the whole game. Along with creating the 8 bit platformer for her, I also included real life presents that she couldn't open yet. And the presents were linked to the game but with a catch. Each level that she'd conquer, (with great effort, haha) she'd unlock a digit to the code on her hidden presents. But not so fast. Each level would be unlocked when two things were True simultaneously: The previous level is completed, and another day has started - ie. at 12 midnight. This ensured that when all the levels are completed one by one with 7 levels in total, and she's on the last level - the last one that will open on Valentine's day (cuz her birthday falls on valentines week), She'd unlock the last digit to the lock when opening the final chest, and then opening her presents irl with the grand completion of the game itself.",
